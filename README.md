# TRGN-510-Final-Project

This repository is for my final project in TRGN 510. 
My goal is to anaysis RNAseq in melanoma, the different RNA expression level between UV and skin melanoma.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

To se the plot, make app.R (click [here](https://github.com/YunchiLi/TRGN-510-Final-Project/blob/master/app.R) to see the code) and Plot.Rmd (click [here](https://github.com/YunchiLi/TRGN-510-Final-Project/blob/master/Plot.Rmd)) to run


Or also can choose see the heatmap, make app2.R (click [here](https://github.com/YunchiLi/TRGN-510-Final-Project/blob/master/app2.R) to see the code) and Final Project.Rmd (click [here](https://github.com/YunchiLi/TRGN-510-Final-Project/blob/master/Final%20Project.Rmd)) to run.

install Rstudio, first. And then import the following data into it. These samples are from [NCIâ€™s Genomic Data Commons](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov). All of them are melanoma RNA-seq in HTSeq-FPKM.

## Running the tests
Open app.R in Rstudio and run it.
Open Plot.Rmd in Rstudio and run the document.
Open app.R on the server, (click [here](https://http://52.14.202.125:3838/yunchili/finalproject/)

## Analysis

By running the code, it will generate PCA plots, heatmap and stats of my data.
